# Capstone Project: Ruby

> This is a capstone project for the Ruby section of the Technical Skills Curriculum.

A capstone project is the closing project that students will solo-perform. Its goal is to assess the student's technical and professional skills from the course that it is closing. For This project, I builded a web scraper that searches for remote web developing jobs a list of the results, detailing their title, company name, location, link and salary.
